Toggle-Message-Box
==================

A toggle sidebar for submitting messages online. Typically needed by all websites. Its very annoying and waste to create a separate page for "Leave a Message". This toggle bar is easy to use and helps to improve UI.

How to use:

Its easy and simple. Just copy the code within <body> of index.html to your HTML page just before end of body tag.

Copy all JavaScript and CSS files to your respective directories.

You are done!! Create a PHP file for form submission.
